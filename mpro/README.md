This project focuses on the fitting of concentration-respose curve (CRC) from biochemical assay of Coronavirus main protease (MPro).

The entire procedure comprises two main steps:
-	Global Fitting: This step utilizes a subset of the data to estimate shared parameters across all datasets.
-	CRC Fitting and pIC50 Estimation: The shared parameters estimated from the global fitting are used to estimate local parameters for each CRC.
